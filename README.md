## Analysis Overview
Performed an exploratory analysis creating visualization to help improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability in underserved areas using rideshare data.

## Results
- There is a larger use of PyBer ridesharing in urban cities.
- There are more drivers in urban cities than rural cities.
- The majority of PyBer's revenue occurs in urban cities.
- The costs for using PyBer is greater among riders in rural cities than urban cities potentially discouraging riders given the high average fare per ride. 
- Drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities. Travel distance could be a key factor.
- PyBer ridersharing services significantly differs in rural, suburban, and urban cities given the number of rides, drivers, and fares.

## Summary
The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides a quick comparison of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary demonstrates that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. Similarily, there was also a larger volume of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. There were 2,405 drivers in urban cities, 490 drivers in suburban cities, and 78 drivers in rural cities. 

Data supports that there is a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides which directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. Although the total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver increases. This is a potential result of the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is low.
